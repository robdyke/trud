# trud
A library to automate downloads from the UK TRUD (Technology Reference data Update Distribution).


## Introduction

The source of reference data in the UK is TRUD. However, until 25/1/2021, users needed to manually download distribution files from a web portal. NHS Digital used to provide an ftp server. NHS Digital have now released an API providing metadata on each reference data release, as well as links to the distribution files themselves.

## Getting started

### 1. Obtain a TRUD API key, and subscribe to reference data.

You will need to register as a user of TRUD and get an API key.
